I'm a Professor in the [Psychology Department at Michigan State University](https://psychology.msu.edu/directory/neal-zachary.html), and an editor at the journal [_Global Networks_](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/journal/14710374). My current research focuses primarily on networks and has touched on topics in several disciplines including geography, sociology, education, and psychology. You can find a list of my published research at [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=HVJX9_gAAAAJ) or in [my CV](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zpneal/zpneal-site/main/contents/zpneal_cv.pdf). In my spare time, I love to travel, particularly to wine regions, learning about local styles and methods of production.
